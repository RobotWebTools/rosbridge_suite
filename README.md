#### Server Implementations of the rosbridge v2 Protocol

rosbridge provides a JSON interface to ROS, allowing any client to send JSON to publish or subscribe to ROS topics, call ROS services, and more. rosbridge supports a variety of transport layers, including WebSockets and TCP. For information on the protocol itself, see the [rosbridge protocol specification](ROSBRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md).

For full documentation, see [the ROS wiki](http://ros.org/wiki/rosbridge_suite).

This project is released as part of the [Robot Web Tools](http://robotwebtools.org/) effort.

### Packages

 * [rosbridge_suite](rosbridge_suite) is a [ROS meta-package](http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin/conceptual_overview#Metapackages_and_the_Elimination_of_Stacks) including all the rosbridge packages.

 * [rosbridge_library](rosbridge_library) contains the Python API that receives JSON-formatted strings as input and controls ROS publishers/subscribers/service calls according to the content of the JSON strings.

 * [rosbridge_server](rosbridge_server) contains a WebSocket server implementation that exposes the rosbridge_library.

 * [rosapi](rosapi) provides service calls for getting meta-information related to ROS like topic lists as well as interacting with the Parameter Server.

### Clients

A rosbridge client is a program that communicates with rosbridge using its JSON API. rosbridge clients include:

 * [roslibjs](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/roslibjs) - A JavaScript API, which communicates with rosbridge over WebSockets.
 * [jrosbridge](https://github.com/WPI-RAIL/jrosbridge) - A Java API, which communicates with rosbridge over WebSockets.
 * [roslibpy](https://github.com/gramaziokohler/roslibpy) - A Python API, which communicates with rosbridge over WebSockets.
 * [roslibrust](https://github.com/Carter12s/roslibrust) - A Rust API, which communicates with rosbridge over WebSockets.

### Release process

Releasing requires push access to [RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite) as well as [ros2-gbp/rosbridge_suite-release](https://github.com/ros2-gbp/rosbridge_suite-release). For more details on how the release process works, see the [bloom tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/How-To-Guides/Releasing-a-ROS-2-package-with-bloom.html).

1. Run `catkin_generate_changelog` to update CHANGELOG.rst files.
2. Manually edit and clean up the changelogs. Commit the changes.
3. Run `catkin_prepare_release --bump [major/minor/patch]` to bump versions in package.xml and push changes to origin.
4. Run bloom-release commands to create PRs to update rosdistro:
    - `bloom-release --rosdistro foxy --track foxy rosbridge_suite`
    - `bloom-release --rosdistro galactic --track galactic rosbridge_suite`
    - `bloom-release --rosdistro rolling --track rolling rosbridge_suite`

Once the PRs are merged, packages will be available for each distro after the next sync. Build/sync status can be viewed at: [foxy](http://repo.ros2.org/status_page/ros_foxy_default.html), [galactic](http://repo.ros2.org/status_page/ros_galactic_default.html), [rolling](http://repo.ros2.org/status_page/ros_rolling_default.html).
